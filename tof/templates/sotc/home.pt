                <h3>Open Source Web Design Template</h3>

                <p>When developing the blog for our new web 2.0 startup, I
                got a template from the open source web design site. I found
                a picture on flickr, which I thought really helped to
                communicate the idea. It was very easy to turn the oswd
                template into a blogger template, and I was very quickly able
                to use the results to demonstrate to the rest of the team the
                basics of blogger. When it came time to deliver the Queen
                Street News, a syndication community based on a cool street
                in Toronto, each of the oswd templates that I tried, gave me
                some difficulties. Embracing this new constraint, I made a
                highly derivative template of my own. I am posting it back on
                the oswd, as a way of thanking my inspiration. <a href=
                    "http://www.oswd.org/">more</a></p>

                <h3>Features</h3>

                <p>The site is intended to be a very readable online
                newspaper. There are no distractions from the news, but still
                a pleasing layout. I preserved the balance and use of fonts
                of my inspirations. It loads really, quickly, which hopefully
                also adds to a professional feel. The intent of our business
                is community marketing through storytelling, much like amazon
                selling books with reviews. We want English majors, to do the
                writing. The technical and design elements are to not
                distract from the excellent writing. The site is valid XHTML
                1.1 and CSS, and I have maintained a standards based approach
                to the more technical aspects of the rest of the project as
                well. <a href=
